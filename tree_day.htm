<h1>Tennessee Tree Day</h1>
<div class="aux">
<p>In March every year, The Robertson County Master Gardeners' Association hosts an event dedicated to distributing tree saplings to enthusiastic
 participants of Tennessee Tree Day. This is a collaborative effort, with master gardener volunteers dedicating their
 time to keep Tennessee green.</p>
 
<p> Tennessee Tree Day was initiated by the Tennessee Environmental Council approximately a decade ago, with an ambitious mission 
to distribute over 1 million native trees to be planted by Tennesseans across the state.</p>

<p>  Volunteer organizations such as the Robertson County Master Gardeners collaborate with the Tennessee Environmental Council
 by meticulously sorting, bundling, and distributing these indigenous tree saplings to eager Tennesseans.  The Environmental Council
 manages tree orders through 
<a href="https://www.tectn.org/" target="_blank">their website</a>, requesting only a small donation, and then coordinates the 
pickup of saplings from local farms, subsequently delivering them to the Robertson County Master
 Gardeners and other volunteer groups. The Robertson County Master Gardeners assemble "orders" for local families or 
 individuals who have requested these trees.</p>
 
  <p>Traditionally, the Robertson County Master Gardeners have distributed trees at the UT Extension office in Springfield, TN. 
 However, starting in 2025, the pickup location will transition to 
 <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/XraNRwiNRh2giCBQ7" target="_blank">The Highland Rim Research and Education Center located at 
 3181 Experiment Station Rd, Springfield, TN 37172. </a> </p>
 
 <p>In 2023, the Robertson County Master Gardeners' Association achieved a significant milestone by distributing over 1,000 trees.
 This accomplishment was surpassed in 2024 when we distributed more than 1,200 trees on Tree Day. You can assist us in setting a new 
 record in 2025 by spreading the word about Tree Day.
