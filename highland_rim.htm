 <b>The Highland Rim Demo Garden</b> pays tribute to Dorothy Briggs, a cherished member of the Robertson County Master Gardener
 community. Since 1934, Dorothy has called Robertson County home, and her dedication to our projects has been unwavering
 since she became a Master Gardener in 2009. Her commitment goes beyond the call of duty, as she consistently devotes more time 
 to our 
 projects than required. Dorothy's passion for gardening stems from her upbringing, inheriting the love from her parents, 
 evidenced by the many plants in her care that originated from their gardens. <br>

The circle garden is a serene spot. Bring a book, take a seat on the bench, and enjoy the tranquility.</p>

<p class = "slidetext"> If you visit the garden in early spring, you may catch sight of a killdeer in the mulch path. 
Killdeers typically inhabit open areas such as fields, meadows, and sandy beaches. Known for their protective nature, 
they guard their nests diligently, so avoid getting too close. Instead of nesting in trees like many other birds, killdeers 
opt for shallow depressions in sand, gravel, dirt, or, in this instance, mulch. This choice helps conceal their eggs, ensuring 
their safety from predators.  <br>

<b>The shade garden</b> <br> Take note of the plants that thrive in shade. This garden features Coral Bells, Hostas,

<b>The Three Sisters Garden</b> <br> The Three Sisters Garden is a perfect example of companion planting, but it is more than just a planting technique. It is a cultural tradition passed down by Indigenous peoples of North America.  This method features corn, beans, and squash planted together in a way that allows them to support one another both physically and nutritionally. 
This system has even been shown to produce higher yields per acre than traditional monoculture row planting. <br>
<b>Meet the Sisters: </b><br> <b>Corn </b>– The Elder Sister stands tall and strong, offering natural support 
for the beans to climb.  <br>
<b>Beans </b>– The Giving Sister
twine around the corn stalk, helping to stabilize it during storms. Beans also enrich the soil by 
fixing nitrogen, which nourishes all three crops. <br>
<b>Squash </b>– The Protective Sister
spreads across the ground, her broad leaves suppressing weeds and retaining soil moisture.
 Her prickly vines also help to deter hungry varmints. </p>
