<h1>Spring Plant Sale</h1>
<div class="aux">
<p>Every year, on the day preceding Mother's Day, the Master Gardeners of Robertson County host a plant sale. 
We kick off the process early in the year by nurturing a diverse range of plants in our greenhouse at Highland 
Rim. As Spring progresses, we tidy up our own gardens and pot any surplus plants to offer to the public during 
our sale. 
<!--Formerly located in front of the UT Extension Office in downtown Springfield, the sale now takes place
 at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/XraNRwiNRh2giCBQ7" target="_blank">The Highland Rim Research and Education Center located at 
 3181 Experiment Station Rd, Springfield, TN 37172. </a></p>  -->
 <p>
 The plant sale will be located at the <a href=
 "https://www.google.com/maps/place/Robertson+County,+University+of+Tennessee+Extension+Office/@36.5094847,-86.88469,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x88645596804cb637:0xeceb6da32ead2710!8m2!3d36.5094847!4d-86.88469!16s%2Fg%2F1tdry12y?entry=ttuUT-Extension Office 
 target="_blank">UT Extension Office, 408 N. Main St, Springfield, TN</a></p>
 However  starting in 2025, the location will transition to
<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/XraNRwiNRh2giCBQ7" target="_blank">The Highland Rim Research and Education Center located at 
 3181 Experiment Station Rd, Springfield, TN 37172. </a></p>   
 The proceeds generated from this event go towards supporting our community projects. It's a 
 win-win situation: you get a great deal, and we reinvest the funds into our community.
