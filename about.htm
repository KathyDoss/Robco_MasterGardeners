<h1> Who are we?</h1>

<div class="aux">
As Tennessee Extension Master Gardeners, we are a dedicated and talented group of volunteers who provide Tennesseans with horticultural 
education. We undergo training and collaborate with the Tennessee Extension Program to deliver research-based information on various 
lawn and garden topics. The Robertson County Master Gardeners, in particular, are highly trained individuals with a passion for plants 
and a commitment to serving the Robertson County community.
