  Our October meeting is coming up on the 23rd and is going to be a good one. Hilary is coming from Cheekwood
  to advise us on fall bulb planting. We’ll be voting on a member proposal, giving a Fair recap, and polling on
  a date for our Christmas party.<br>
  
  <br>
<b><i>November 8, 2025 9AM - 12</i></b><br>
 We also have a fall work day coming up November 8. It’s time to put the beds to rest for the winter, 
clean up, mulch, and start thinking about spring. We’ll need as many hands on deck as we can get.
