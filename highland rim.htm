The crops of corn, beans, and squash are known as the Three Sisters. For centuries these three crops have been the center of Native American agriculture and culinary traditions. It is for good reason as these three crops complement each other in the garden as well as nutritionally.

Corn provides tall stalks for the beans to climb so that they are not out-competed by sprawling squash vines. Beans provide nitrogen to fertilize the soil while also stabilizing the tall corn during heavy winds. Beans are nitrogen-fixers meaning they host rhizobia on their roots that can take nitrogen, a much needed plant nutrient, from the air and convert it into forms that can be absorbed by plant roots. The large leaves of squash plants shade the ground which helps retain soil moisture and prevent weeds.

<p class = "slidetext"> There aren’t very many plants that come in a wider range of color than iris. In the past 50 years, thousands of cultivars in various colors, sizes, and forms have been developed. We have about 20 cultivars of bearded iris in our garden. 

Iris are divided into three categories – bearded, beardless, and aril – according to The American Iris Society. Many types are long-lived perennials in Central Illinois. Iris range in height from 6-inch-tall dwarf crested iris to 5-feet-tall yellow flag iris. <br><br>

The Iris, family Iridaceae, was designated the official state cultivated flower in 1973 by the 88th General Assembly. The iris is a herbaceous perennial of which there are about 170 species, the most common of which is the Blue Flag. While there are several different colors among the iris, the act naming the iris as the state flower did not name a particular color. By common acceptance, the purple iris is considered the state cultivated flower.

<p class="slidetext">Since the mid-1990s, the population of eastern monarch butterflies has declined by about 85 percent. This year’s population count, released in May 2022, showed a slight uptick in the number of occupied acres of winter habitat in Mexico. Unfortunately, it amounted to only abut 7 acres – well under the circa 14.8 acre extinction threshold that scientists estimate monarchs must maintain for their long-term survival.

Reasons for the decline include loss of summer breeding grounds due to agriculture and suburban sprawl, habitat fragmentation, chemical use (herbicides that kill milkweed and pesticides that kill monarchs), climate change, and more recently, an increase in illegal logging in the Mexican butterfly reserves. Since the 1990s, North American monarchs (east and west) have lost about 167 million acres of breeding ground – more than four times the size of the State of Virginia. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has yet to act on a petition to recognize monarchs as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. </p>
